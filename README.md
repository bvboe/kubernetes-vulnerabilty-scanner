# Kubernetes Vulnerability Scanner
Application for scanning the containers in your Kubernetes cluster for vulnerabilities!

## Installation
Spin up or connect to your favorite Kubernetes cluster. In this case, https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/.
```
$ minikube start
```
Download and deploy the Kubernetes scanner
```
$ git clone https://github.com/bvboe/kubernetes-vulnerabilty-scanner/
$ cd kubernetes-vulnerabilty-scanner/
$ helm upgrade --install k8s-scanner k8s-vuln-scanner --set clusterName="Minikube Cluster" --wait
Release "k8s-scanner" does not exist. Installing it now.
Congratulations! The Kubernetes Vulnerability Scanner is now up and running.

To access the web ui, run the following command:
kubectl port-forward service/web-frontend 8080:80
And access the UI on http://localhost:8080
```
Once it's running open up a connection to the web frontend
```
$ kubectl port-forward service/web-frontend 8080:80
```
Open up your browser at http://localhost:8080 and you're up and running.

## Forward data to Prometheus and Grafana for more analysis
This adds Prometheus and Grafana to analyze the data for this Minikube cluster. This deployment approach can modified to monitor multiple Kubernetes clusters.

Install Prometheus and Grafana, configured to retrieve data from the Kubernetes scanner:
```
$ helm upgrade --install k8s-monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --set "prometheus.prometheusSpec.additionalScrapeConfigs[0].job_name=Kubernetes-Vulnerability-Scanner" \
  --set "prometheus.prometheusSpec.additionalScrapeConfigs[0].metrics_path=/metrics" \
  --set "prometheus.prometheusSpec.additionalScrapeConfigs[0].static_configs[0].targets[0]=vulnerability-coordinator:80" \
  --wait
Release "k8s-monitoring" does not exist. Installing it now.

kube-prometheus-stack has been installed. Check its status by running:
  kubectl --namespace default get pods -l "release=k8s-monitoring"

Visit https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus for instructions on how to create & configure Alertmanager and Prometheus instances using the Operator.
```

### Explore data in Prometheus
Get access to the Prometheus by running the following command:
```
$ kubectl port-forward svc/k8s-monitoring-kube-promet-prometheus 9090
```

Open http://localhost:9090 and validate that Prometheus is reading data.

Prometheus is importing the following metrics from the Kubernetes scanner:
* kubernetes_vulnerability_results
* kubernetes_vulnerability_sbom
* kubernetes_vulnerability_scanned_containers

This gives information about vulnerabilities found, the software bill of materials for these workloads and an indicator of how many workloads have been scanned.

Also feel free to explore some of the data within Prometheus:

### Analyze data in Grafana
Get access to the Grafana by running the following command:
```
$ kubectl port-forward service/k8s-monitoring-grafana 3000:80
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and log in using default username/password admin/prom-operator:

Open Dashboard page and click New -> Import to import a pre-built Kubernetes vulnerability dashboard:

Open the following link in a separate window, copy into the JSON model window and click Load:

### A note about monitoring multiple Kubernetes clusters
It's important that each cluster is given a unique name, which is given when installing the Kubernetes Vulnerability Scanner, as shown below:
```
$ helm upgrade --install k8s-scanner k8s-vuln-scanner --set clusterName="SET NAME OF CLUSTER HERE" --wait
```

Additional clusters can be added to the Prometheus configuration by modifying the helm installation as follows:
```
$ helm upgrade --install k8s-monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --set "prometheus.prometheusSpec.additionalScrapeConfigs[0].job_name=Kubernetes-Vulnerability-Scanner" \
  --set "prometheus.prometheusSpec.additionalScrapeConfigs[0].metrics_path=/metrics" \
  --set "prometheus.prometheusSpec.additionalScrapeConfigs[0].static_configs[0].targets[0]=vulnerability-coordinator:80" \
  --set "prometheus.prometheusSpec.additionalScrapeConfigs[0].static_configs[0].targets[1]=cluster-number-two:80" \
  --set "prometheus.prometheusSpec.additionalScrapeConfigs[0].static_configs[0].targets[2]=cluster-number-three:80" \
  --wait
```

## Uninstallation
Use Helm to see what's installed
```
$ helm list
NAME          	NAMESPACE	REVISION	STATUS  	CHART                       	APP VERSION
k8s-monitoring	default  	1       	deployed	kube-prometheus-stack-63.1.0	v0.76.1
k8s-scanner   	default  	1       	deployed	k8s-vuln-scanner-0.1.17     	0.1.17
```

Ask Helm to delete the monitoring and scanning components:
```
$ helm delete k8s-monitoring k8s-scanner
release "k8s-monitoring" uninstalled
release "k8s-scanner" uninstalled
```

## Troubleshooting and Testing
The scanner is designed to work with Kubernetes running on Docker and ContainerD, and has been tested on the following Kubernetes distributions:
* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
* K3s
* MicroK8s
* Kubeadm on ContainerD
* Minikube
* Kind

The scanner is currently not integrated with CRI-O.

The scanner will also require read-only access to the host operating system and leverages a Persistent Volume Claim for caching scan results. The use of a Persistent Volume Claim can be disabled by adding `--set vulnerabilityCoordinator.externalStorage=false` to the helm installation command.
